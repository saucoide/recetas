4. After the resting time, the surface should be dotted with bubbles
5. Spread flour over a surface and place the dough on it  
6. Fold the dough on itself it once or twice, shaping it a bit
7. Cover it again with the plastic wrap and let it rest for 15min (these previous 2 steps can be repeated but it is not needed)

8. Coat a towel with flour or some other grains  
9. Gently shape the dough into a bowl, place it on top of the towel, and cover it with the rest of the towel
10. This is also the moment where you'd add seeds or anything else you want on the exterior of the bread
11. Let it rise for 2 hours, it should be ready when you can poke it and it will not bounce back quickly

12. Heat the oven to 230C with a heavy mold or recipient inside (the mold should be hot), once the dough is ready, transfer it into the recipient, flipping it so that what used to be bottom is not the top side
13. Cover the recipient with a lid, or aluminum foil and bake for 30min
14. Remove the cover and bake for another 15 to 30min, until it has browned
